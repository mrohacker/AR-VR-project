These are simple ar and vr projects build with unity 6
🚀 AR + VR Interactive Experience (Unity 6)

Welcome to my Unity project that brings Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) together!
This repo includes two immersive mini projects built with Unity 6 — one for AR-based object spawning in real-world space, and another for a simple VR shooting game using mouse, keyboard, or headset controls.

🌌 AR Space Object Spawner

A lightweight AR experience that allows users to place 3D space objects (like planets, cubes, or chairs) in their real-world environment using ARCore.
It uses Unity’s AR Foundation to detect planes and anchor objects dynamically in your surroundings.

🪐 Features:

Plane detection using ARCore (via Unity XR Plugin Management)

Tap-to-place 3D objects in real space

Random color/material applied to each spawned object

Realistic scale and shadows

Optimized for Android (works with AR-supported phones)

🧩 Tools & Tech:

Unity 6.2

AR Foundation & ARCore XR Plugin

C# for object placement logic

Android Build Support

Mobile Camera Integration

🔫 VR Shooting Game (Desktop / Mobile VR)

A small, fun VR-style experience built in Unity — shoot colored targets in a 3D arena using your mouse and keyboard (or VR headset if available).
The project focuses on basic interaction, shooting mechanics, and Unity physics.

🎮 Features:

Player movement (W/A/S/D)

Mouse look / aim

Shooting projectiles using Spacebar or left-click

Rigidbody-based bullet physics

Randomly colored floating targets

Works on desktop (non-VR) and VR headset mode

🧰 Tools & Tech:

Unity 6

Basic C# scripting

Physics-based projectiles

Lighting, materials, and prefabs

Optional VR/AR setup through Unity XR Toolkit.
